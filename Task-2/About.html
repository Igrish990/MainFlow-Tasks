        For nearly four decades, Green Foods has treated our diverse customer
        base to high-quality, natural dietary supplements made with care and
        without a hint of compromise. As an industry leader, we take pride in
        developing clean, delicious products that marry taste and nutrition for
        results that are eye-opening in a multitude of ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe in the potential found in fresh grasses, fruits, vegetables,
        herbs, and other whole foods, and that using those compounds to nourish
        our bodies is the key to good health. To that end, our dynamic catalog
        of natural, organic, and bioavailable products is brimming with
        essential vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and phytochemicals that,
        while effective separately, come together to form an exponentially more
        potent whole.
